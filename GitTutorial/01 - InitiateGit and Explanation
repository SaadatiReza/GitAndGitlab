# How to Create a simple Git project
You could create a repository in two main ways
* Create a directory then switch to the new directory then execute the below command
```bash
git init
```
* You could automatically create and initiate git repository at the same time with the below command.
```bash
git init "the name of the repo"
```

# File  Lifecycle

There are 4 different state for each file in git.
* Untracked
* Unmodified
* Modified
* Staged


# Git configurations can be set at three levels
* system --> For running Operation System
* global --> For a certain User
* local --> For a specified Repository

You can check the set config in operating system with the below command
``` 
git config --list
```
You can set the credential for user in global wide with the below command
```
git config --global user.name ""
git config --global user.email ""
```
you could set this configuration at local level
```
git config --local user.name ""
git config --local user.email ""
```

keep in mind that when you set the configuration in local level this configuration will be kept in **.git** directory,however, when it comes to global level, this configuration will be placed in **$HOME/.gitconfig**
